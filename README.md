# WMS Image Semantic Segmentation

This repository implements a semantic segmentation model for image analysis, focusing on WMS (Web Map Services) images The goal is to accurately segment various elements in warehouse images using deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Preprocessing of images
- Model architecture for semantic segmentation
- Training, testing, and validation notebooks
- Performance evaluation metrics

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivamprasad1001/WMS-Image-Semantic-segmentation.git
   ```



## Dataset
The dataset is included in the repository. It contains WMS-related images for semantic segmentation tasks.

## Results
- The model achieves high accuracy if all epochs is trains in segmenting different warehouse components.
